                <p>In recent years, Unified Payments Interface <a href="https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/product-overview" target="_blank">(UPI)</a> has emerged as the backbone of Indiaâ€™s digital payment revolution. From small shops in rural areas to thriving e-commerce startups, Indian businesses of all sizes are going all-in on UPI.</p>

                <p>But why? And what makes UPI a must-have for your business too?</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">What Is UPI?</h2>

                <p>UPI is a real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India <a
                        href="https://www.npci.org.in/" target="_blank">(NPCI).</a> It allows money transfers between bank accounts using a mobile app â€” instantly and securely, without needing account numbers or IFSC codes.</p>

                <p>With over 11 billion transactions per month, UPI has truly changed how India pays.</p>

                <p>No more delays. With UPI, funds are transferred in real-time, which helps businesses manage cash flow, restock inventory, and pay staff faster.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">2. Minimal to Zero Transaction Fees</h3>
                <p>Unlike credit card payments that charge 1.5%â€“2.5%, UPI transactions are mostly free or extremely low-cost â€” saving thousands monthly.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">6. Government-Backed Trust</h3>
                <p>UPI is backed by the RBI and Indian banks. Itâ€™s one of the most secure payment systems in the world, with two-factor authentication and encrypted data.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">New UPI Features You Should Know</h2>
